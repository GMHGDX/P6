Listen to 'The Time' (Dirty Bit) by the black eyed peas while grading this project

What doesn't work: 
Ending program after 100 processes/3 seconds. The program just pauses when there are no more messages in the queue (when no more processes are available). Failing to fork after 18 processes. Everything else works fine. 

Special Notes: 
Head is not shown in the frame table, but it does say what frame the head is at as one of the print outs ("OSS: Head is now at frame 4")
