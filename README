Listen to 'The Time' (Dirty Bit) by the black eyed peas while grading this project

Everything will run properly in this project.

Special Notes: 
Head is not shown in the frame table, but it does say what frame the head is at as one of the print outs ("OSS: Head is now at frame 4")

To run the project:
1) make
2) ./oss -f "logFileName"

(If you do not put in a file name, then it will create a logfile called 'logfile')
